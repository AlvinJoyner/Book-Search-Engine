# Book-Search-Engine

Welcome to my M.E.R.N project! This README provides a brief overview of the project structure, setup, and usage.

## Description

A fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
